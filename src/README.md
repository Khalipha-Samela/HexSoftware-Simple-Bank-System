### 3. **Transactions Menu**
- Users can:
  - Check Balance (`BalanceEnquiry.java`)
  - Deposit Funds (`Deposit.java`)
  - Withdraw Funds (`Withdrawal.java`)
  - Use Fast Cash (`FastCash.java`) â€“ Quick withdrawal in fixed amounts
  - View Mini Statement (`MiniStatement.java`)

### 4. **Database**
- All transactions (type, amount, date) are saved under the user's PIN.
- Stored in a table called `bank`.
